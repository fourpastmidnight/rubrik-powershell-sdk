# How to make an SDK release

## Prerequisites

- You need to be an admin on the github repo.
- Start in the `devel` branch, make sure it is up to date with
  the `origin/devel` branch, and that there are no uncommitted changes.

## Steps

### 1. Check what is currently released

```powershell
.\Utils\admin\Test-RscSdkRelease.ps1
```

This script checks the current
release status of the SDK. Run it to see what is currently released.
It will also make sure the release is coherent: what is on the `main`
branch is what's on GitHub and also what's on the PowerShell gallery.

### 2. Check the release candidate

The release candidate is the `devel` branch.

We want to make sure the package version is newer than what is currently
released, and that it matches the latest entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.

```powershell
.\Utils\admin\Test-RscSdkCandidate.ps1
```

If the version is not set on the package, or if it is not the same as the
latest entry in `CHANGELOG.md`, you need push a new commit to the `devel`
branch with the updated version:

```powershell
.\Utils\admin\Set-RscSdkVersion.ps1 <maj>.<min>
```

Then run `Test-RscSdkCandidate.ps1` again to verify.

Verify also that the latest entry in `CHANGELOG.md` is correct.

```powershell
git commit -a -m "Bump version to <maj>.<min>"
git push
```

### 3. Create a new release

First do a dry run to see what will be released:

```powershell
.\Utils\admin\New-RscSdkRelease.ps1
```

If everything looks good, run the script again with the `-NotDryRun` switch:

```powershell
.\Utils\admin\New-RscSdkRelease.ps1 -NotDry
```
