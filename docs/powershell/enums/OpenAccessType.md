### OpenAccessType
OpenAccessType is used to indicate the file's open access type.

- NOT_OPEN - Not open.
- INHERITED - Inherited open.
- EXPLICIT - Explicitly open.
- PUBLIC - Publicly accessible.
- UNKNOWN_ACCESS - Deprecated. Still defined here because it is still present in sstables
and in root results in the DB.
